# Copilot Visualizer

A custom chatbot application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, designed to resemble Microsoft Copilot. It uses Azure OpenAI to provide a rich, interactive chat experience with features like inline anchors and persona adaptation.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: A clean, responsive UI mimicking Microsoft Copilot.
- **Conversational Journeys**: The homepage features smart "hooks" generated by analyzing user history. The system identifies "High-Value Incomplete Tasks" (e.g., unfinished coding or planning) and suggests relevant next steps using "Rich Tiles" (Title + Context).
- **Runtime Configuration**: Bring your own keys! Easily configure Azure OpenAI credentials directly in the app settings (stored locally).
- **Inline Analyzers**: The AI automatically identifies interesting terms ("Anchors") in its response and provides "pop-up" follow-up questions when you hover over them.
- **Persona Modes**: Adapt the AI's suggestions based on different user personas (e.g., Developer, Business Leader, Creative).
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Connects to your Azure OpenAI deployments for secure inference.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- Access to an Azure OpenAI resource (Endpoint, API Key, Deployment Name)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luckyloneranger/copilot-visualizer.git
   cd copilot-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Launch the App**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Configuration

You can configure the application in two ways:

**Option 1: Runtime Configuration (Recommended for Quick Testing)**
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Click the **Settings (Gear Icon)** in the sidebar.
3. Enter your Azure OpenAI credentials:
   - **Endpoint**: `https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/`
   - **API Key**: `your-api-key`
   - **Deployment Name**: `gpt-4` (or your model name)
   - **API Version**: `2024-02-15-preview`
4. Click "Save Configuration". These settings are saved in your browser's local storage.

**Option 2: Environment Variables (For Persistent Dev Setup)**
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:
```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
```
*Note: Runtime settings in the UI will override these environment variables.*
