# Copilot Visualizer - Project Instructions

## Project Requirements
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements: User wants to add runtime credential configuration for Azure OpenAI.
- [x] Scaffold the Project: Existing Next.js project.
- [x] Customize the Project: Added Request Credentials feature.
- [ ] Install Required Extensions: None needed.
- [x] Compile the Project: Application is ready to run.
- [ ] Create and Run Task: None needed.
- [ ] Launch the Project: User can launch with `npm run dev`.
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete: README and instructions updated.

## Feature Implementation Details
- **Runtime Credentials**: Users can now click the "Settings" gear icon in the sidebar to enter their Azure OpenAI Endpoint, API Key, Deployment Name, and API Version. These are saved to their browser's Local Storage.
- **Priority**: Credentials entered in the UI take precedence over `.env` variables.
- **Security**: Credentials are stored only in the user's browser (localStorage) and sent securely via HTTPS to the API routes. They are not stored in any database.
- **Conversational Journeys**: The homepage features smart "hooks" generated by analyzing user history. The system identifies "High-Value Incomplete Tasks" and suggests relevant next steps using "Rich Tiles" (Title + Context).
- **Architecture**: `ChatInterface.tsx` dynamically renders either standard suggestion chips or rich conversational hooks based on the data shape returned from the API.

## Debugging
- If the chat fails, check the Settings modal to ensure valid credentials are provided.
- Check the browser console and network tab for API errors.
